Sure! Let's break down the CodeDoc Agent project into more manageable, digestible steps. We'll go through the high-level steps and then break down each one further into sub-steps.
1. Set Up Development Environment
1.1 Install Required Dependencies

Make sure you have all the necessary tools and frameworks:

    NVIDIA Agent Toolkit: Core framework for the agent.

    LangChain / LlamaIndex: For reasoning and context handling.

    Hugging Face / NVIDIA NeMo: For embeddings.

    GitPython: For interacting with Git repositories.

    Tree-sitter: For code parsing.

    Streamlit or Gradio: For creating the user interface.

Use the following commands to install them:

pip install nvidia-agent-toolkit langchain huggingface_hub gitpython tree-sitter streamlit faiss-cpu

2. Set Up Core Architecture
2.1 User Interface (Frontend)

The frontend allows users to interact with the agent. For simplicity, we'll use Streamlit to build an easy-to-use UI.

Sub-steps:

    Create a basic interface that allows the user to:

        Upload a codebase (using a file uploader).

        Ask questions related to the code (text input).

        Display results (e.g., code descriptions, refactor suggestions).

Code Example:

import streamlit as st

# Title
st.title("CodeDoc Agent")

# Codebase upload
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload your codebase", type=["zip", "tar", "gz"])

# User query input
user_query = st.text_input("Ask a technical question")

# Display result
if uploaded_file and user_query:
    # This is where the backend processes the input
    st.write(f"Processing query: {user_query}")

2.2 Agent Intelligence Toolkit (Core)

This component will handle reasoning, context retrieval, and response generation.

Sub-steps:

    Set up the LangChain or LlamaIndex reasoning engine.

    This engine will process user queries, retrieve the relevant code context, and provide answers.

Code Example:

from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

# Initialize LLM (Large Language Model)
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm)

def process_query(query):
    return conversation.predict(input=query)

2.3 Codebase Tool (Code Parsing)

We will use Tree-sitter to parse the uploaded codebase into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This helps understand the structure of the code.

Sub-steps:

    Install and set up Tree-sitter for code parsing.

    Parse code and retrieve functions, classes, and comments.

Code Example:

from tree_sitter import Language, Parser

# Load Tree-sitter language parser for Python (can adapt for others)
parser = Parser()
parser.set_language(Language('path/to/my-languages.so', 'python'))

# Parse a file
with open("example.py", 'r') as f:
    code = f.read()

tree = parser.parse(bytes(code, "utf8"))

2.4 Vector Search and Embeddings

We need to embed the code into vectors for fast search. We'll use Hugging Face Transformers or NVIDIA NeMo for creating these embeddings.

Sub-steps:

    Use a pre-trained model to convert code into vector embeddings.

    Store these embeddings in a FAISS index for fast similarity search.

Code Example:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Initialize model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Get embedding for a code snippet
def get_embedding(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).squeeze().detach().numpy()

# Create FAISS index for search
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(768)  # Embedding dimension

2.5 Memory (Context Retention)

The agent should retain the context of past interactions (user queries) for future sessions. This can be done using vector storage (FAISS) for storing past queries and responses.

Sub-steps:

    Store embeddings of previous queries in the vector database.

    Retrieve the relevant past context when a new query is made.

Code Example:

# Store past query embeddings and results in FAISS
past_queries = []
def add_to_memory(query, result):
    embedding = get_embedding(query)
    index.add(np.array([embedding]))
    past_queries.append((query, result))

3. Core Features
3.1 Code QA

Allow users to ask specific questions about the codebase, such as:

    "What does this function do?"

    "Where is logging handled?"

Sub-steps:

    Use the code parsing and vector search to answer these queries.

    Match the query with relevant code and provide an explanation.

Code Example:

def answer_code_query(query):
    embedding = get_embedding(query)
    distances, indices = index.search(np.array([embedding]), k=3)
    # Retrieve the most relevant code
    relevant_code = [past_queries[i][1] for i in indices[0]]
    return relevant_code

3.2 Auto Docs

Automatically generate documentation for functions, classes, or the whole project.

Sub-steps:

    Use LLM (Large Language Models) to generate docstrings or a README file.

    Parse the code and generate function-level or class-level docstrings.

Code Example:

def generate_docstring(function_code):
    prompt = f"Generate a docstring for this function:\n{function_code}"
    return llm.generate(prompt)

3.3 Refactor Suggestions

Suggest improvements or optimizations for the code, such as better readability, performance, or security.

Sub-steps:

    Use AI models to analyze the code and provide suggestions.

    Handle security or performance warnings.

Code Example:

def suggest_refactors(function_code):
    prompt = f"Suggest improvements for the following function:\n{function_code}"
    return llm.generate(prompt)

4. Integration of All Components

Now we bring everything together:

    Frontend: Streamlit captures user queries and uploaded codebase.

    Core System: The agent answers questions, generates documentation, and suggests improvements based on the codebase.

    Memory: Remembers past queries and their responses for context-based results.

Example Integration:

# Inside your Streamlit app
if uploaded_file and user_query:
    # Process the query
    answer = process_query(user_query)
    st.write(answer)

    # Generate documentation
    doc = generate_docstring(some_function_code)
    st.write(doc)
    
    # Suggest refactors
    refactor_suggestions = suggest_refactors(some_function_code)
    st.write(refactor_suggestions)

5. Testing and Deployment
5.1 Unit Testing

Write unit tests for individual components to ensure that each part (code parsing, vector search, documentation generation, etc.) works correctly.
5.2 End-to-End Testing

Ensure the entire workflow functions smoothly by running tests on different codebases.
5.3 Deployment

    Use Docker to containerize the application.

    Deploy it using cloud services like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

Docker Example:

FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]

Sure! Let’s break each step down into more detailed sub-steps with examples to clarify exactly how you’ll implement the CodeDoc Agent. This will give you a deeper understanding of the process and how to implement each component.
1. Set Up Development Environment

The first thing we need to do is make sure your development environment is ready.
1.1 Install Required Dependencies

    NVIDIA Agent Toolkit: This is the core framework that powers the agent.

    LangChain / LlamaIndex: This handles context-based reasoning and query answering.

    Hugging Face / NVIDIA NeMo: These are used for generating and retrieving embeddings for code and queries.

    GitPython: Lets you interact with code repositories (e.g., pull a codebase directly from GitHub).

    Tree-sitter: Parses code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for better code analysis.

    Streamlit / Gradio: For building the frontend where users interact with the agent.

    FAISS: A library for fast similarity search, especially for vectorized embeddings.

Install dependencies:

pip install nvidia-agent-toolkit langchain huggingface_hub gitpython tree-sitter streamlit faiss-cpu

You can also add additional libraries if needed, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow if you're working with deep learning models.
2. Set Up Core Architecture
2.1 User Interface (Frontend)

The frontend is where the user interacts with the CodeDoc Agent. We’ll use Streamlit to create a simple interface.

Sub-steps:

    Title and Instructions: Display the purpose of the app.

    File Upload: Let users upload a codebase (e.g., a ZIP file containing their Python files).

    Query Input: Allow users to type in their questions (e.g., "What does this function do?").

    Display Results: Show the results to the user (answers, docstrings, refactor suggestions).

Example:

import streamlit as st

# Title and instructions
st.title("CodeDoc Agent")
st.write("Upload a codebase and ask technical questions about it.")

# File upload
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload your codebase (ZIP format)", type=["zip"])

# Query input
user_query = st.text_input("Ask a technical question (e.g., 'What does this function do?')")

# Display result if inputs exist
if uploaded_file and user_query:
    st.write(f"Processing your query: {user_query}")
    # Backend processing will happen here

    Upload Handling: The uploaded file is processed, and the code inside it is extracted for further analysis.

2.2 Agent Intelligence Toolkit (Core)

This part of the system is responsible for reasoning, generating responses to user queries, and interacting with the codebase.

We use LangChain or LlamaIndex as the reasoning engine to generate answers based on the user query and the code context.

Sub-steps:

    Initialize the LLM (Large Language Model): Choose a model like OpenAI GPT, Llama, or NVIDIA’s own model to process user queries.

    Context Handling: Retrieve relevant context from the codebase to provide an accurate answer.

Example:

from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

# Initialize OpenAI LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)  # You can also use a local model
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm)

def process_query(query):
    # Pass the user query to the LLM and get the response
    return conversation.predict(input=query)

# Example usage
query_response = process_query("What does this function do?")
print(query_response)

    Conversation Chain: This setup will maintain context for multi-turn interactions. You could store previous queries and results in memory (more on that later).

2.3 Codebase Tool (Code Parsing)

We need to parse the uploaded code to extract useful information, such as functions, classes, and docstrings. This will allow the agent to answer specific queries like "What does this function do?"

We'll use Tree-sitter for code parsing. Tree-sitter provides an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the code, which is essential for analyzing code structure.

Sub-steps:

    Tree-sitter Setup: Load the code language (Python, JavaScript, etc.) parser for Tree-sitter.

    Parse the Code: Convert the code into an AST that can be traversed and analyzed.

Example:

from tree_sitter import Language, Parser

# Load the Tree-sitter Python parser (you need to build it beforehand)
parser = Parser()
parser.set_language(Language('path/to/my-languages.so', 'python'))

# Parse the code file
with open("example.py", 'r') as f:
    code = f.read()

# Parse the code and get the AST
tree = parser.parse(bytes(code, "utf8"))

# Example of traversing the AST
root_node = tree.root_node
print("Root node:", root_node)

    AST Traversal: After parsing, you can extract function definitions, class declarations, and comments, which will be useful for answering queries like "Where is logging handled?" or "Show me the function definitions."

2.4 Vector Search and Embeddings

This component is essential for fast searching and retrieving relevant information from the codebase. We’ll generate embeddings (vector representations) of the code and user queries to enable similarity-based search.

We'll use Hugging Face’s Transformers or NVIDIA NeMo to create these embeddings.

Sub-steps:

    Embedding Generation: Convert the code and queries into embeddings.

    Similarity Search: Store embeddings in FAISS, a fast search library, to find the most relevant pieces of code based on a user's query.

Example:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Initialize Hugging Face model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Generate embedding for a piece of code or a query
def get_embedding(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).squeeze().detach().numpy()

# Example: Create FAISS index
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(768)  # 768 is the dimension of the BERT embeddings

# Add embeddings to FAISS index
code_embedding = get_embedding("def example_function(): pass")
index.add(np.array([code_embedding]))

# Search the index for similar queries
def search_query(query):
    query_embedding = get_embedding(query)
    distances, indices = index.search(np.array([query_embedding]), k=5)
    return indices

# Example usage
search_results = search_query("How do I define a function?")
print(search_results)

    FAISS Index: This stores the embeddings of code snippets, and allows for fast retrieval based on similarity to a user query.

2.5 Memory (Context Retention)

To make the CodeDoc Agent more intelligent, we should retain the context of past interactions. This allows the agent to remember previous user queries and offer better responses in subsequent interactions.

Sub-steps:

    Store Past Queries: Store both the queries and their corresponding answers as embeddings in the vector store (FAISS).

    Retrieve Context: When a new query comes in, fetch the relevant context from previous interactions.

Example:

# Store past queries and answers in memory
memory_store = []

def add_to_memory(query, result):
    memory_store.append((query, result))

# Retrieve the most relevant past query
def get_relevant_context(new_query):
    # For simplicity, return all past queries (you could do a similarity search here)
    return [memory for memory in memory_store if new_query.lower() in memory[0].lower()]

    Memory Search: When the user asks a question, you can search for past queries to provide a more contextualized response.

3. Core Features
3.1 Code QA (Query Answering)

The agent should answer specific questions about the codebase, such as:

    "What does this function do?"

    "Where is logging handled?"

    "What classes are defined in this file?"

Sub-steps:

    Parse the codebase to find functions and classes.

    Embed and search the codebase for relevant pieces that answer the user’s query.

    Generate response based on the search results and context.

Example:

def answer_code_query(query):
    relevant_code = search_query(query)  # Search for relevant code based on query embedding
    return f"Found {len(relevant_code)} results that might help."

3.2 Auto Docs (Automatic Documentation)

Automatically generate documentation, such as docstrings for functions or classes, or an entire README for the project.

Sub-steps:

    Generate docstrings for individual functions or classes.

    Generate project-level documentation (README) based on the structure of the code.

Example:

def generate_docstring(function_code):
    # Use the LLM to generate a docstring for the given function code
    prompt = f"Generate a docstring for the following Python function:\n{function_code}"
    docstring = llm.generate(prompt)
    return docstring

3.3 Refactor Suggestions

Provide refactor suggestions for code to improve readability, performance, or security.

Sub-steps:

    Analyze code for potential improvements (e.g., variable naming, performance bottlenecks, security flaws).

    Generate refactor suggestions with the help of a model like GPT.

Example:

def suggest_refactors(function_code):
    # Call the LLM to suggest improvements for the function
    prompt = f"Suggest improvements for the following function:\n{function_code}"
    suggestions = llm.generate(prompt)
    return suggestions

4. Integrate All Components

Now that you have all the individual components set up, integrate them into one cohesive system where:

    Frontend (Streamlit) collects user input.

    Backend (LangChain + LlamaIndex) processes the queries and retrieves answers, documentation, or suggestions.

    Memory stores and retrieves relevant past queries for improved responses.

Example:

# Streamlit UI
if uploaded_file and user_query:
    codebase = process_codebase(uploaded_file)  # Parse the uploaded code
    response = process_query(user_query)  # Process the query
    st.write(response)

5. Testing and Deployment
5.1 Unit Testing

Test individual components like code parsing, query answering, and embedding generation.
5.2 End-to-End Testing

Run the full system with a sample codebase to ensure everything works together.
5.3 Deployment
